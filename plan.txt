some unsorted notes:

- level of detail concept for adaptive/dynamic content reduction
- sampling of glyph rendering (antialiasing), e.g., configurable subpixel sampling strategies and multi-sampling approaches
- mulit-language kerning interferface
- dynamic/custom glyphs with cached rendering
- caching of glyphs (differentiation between static and dynamic glyphs)
- semantic labels in combination with lod
- utilities such as line rendering
- stylization such as color, background color, outline, glow, ...
- imperative placement interface for 2d and 3d placement
- describtive placement interface for automated, adaptive placement
